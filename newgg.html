    <h2>Step 1: The Alert Box</h2>
    <p>
        The first concept in your book is the

        alert. An alert box is a simple way to display a message to the user in a pop-up window.

        Syntax: The basic code for an alert is alert("Your message here.");.

        Example: To display a message that says "Hello, World!", you would write: alert("Hello, World!");.

        How to run it: You can write this code inside a
        script tag in an HTML file and open that file in your web browser.When the page loads, the alert box will pop
        up.
    </p>
    <h2> Step 2: Variables for Strings</h2>
    <p>
        Next, your book introduces

        variables for strings.A variable is like a container where you can store a value.A string is a sequence of
        characters, like text.

        Declaration: To create a variable, you use the var keyword, followed by a name for your variable.For example:
        var myName;.

        Assignment: To store a value in a variable, you use the equals sign(=).You enclose string values in quotes("" or
        '').

        Example: var myName = "John Doe";.

        Using variables in alerts: You can use variables inside your alert boxes.

        Example:
        var greeting = "Hello, user!";
        alert(greeting);
    </p>

        Assignment: To store a value in a variable, you use the equals sign (=). You enclose string values in quotes (""
        or '').

        Example: var myName = "John Doe";.

        Using variables in alerts: You can use variables inside your alert boxes.

        Example:

        JavaScript

        var greeting = "Hello, user!";
        alert(greeting);
        Step 3: Variables for Numbers
        The third step is working with

        variables for numbers. This is similar to strings, but you don't use quotes.

        Example:
        var myAge = 25;
        alert(myAge);
    </p>
    <h2>Step 4: Git and GitHub Integration</h2>
    <p>As you start writing these simple JavaScript files, it's a great time to begin using Git and GitHub. This will
        help you track your progress.

        Create a folder: On your computer, create a new folder for your JavaScript work.

        Initialize Git: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to that folder, and type git init. This will
        create a local Git repository.

        Write your code: Create a file (e.g., step1.js) and write the JavaScript code from Step 1.

        Add and Commit:

        In your terminal, type git add . to stage the file.

        Then, type git commit -m "Added my first JavaScript alert." to save a snapshot of your work.

        Create a GitHub repository: Go to GitHub, create a new empty repository, and follow the instructions to link
        your local folder to it using git remote add and git push.

        Now, every time you complete a new step or exercise, you can add and commit your changes, creating a history of
        your learning journey.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Math Expressions: Familiar Operators</h2>
    <p>
        You're already familiar with the basic math operators from school. In JavaScript, they work similarly.

        + for addition

        - for subtraction

        * for multiplication

        / for division

        You can use these operators with both numbers and variables.

        Example:
        var costOfItem = 5;
        var taxRate = 0.07;
        var totalCost = costOfItem * (1 + taxRate);
        alert(totalCost); // This will display 5.35 in an alert box
    </p>
